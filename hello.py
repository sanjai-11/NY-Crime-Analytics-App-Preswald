This dashboard presents crime statistics for all counties in New York State from 1990 to the present. The dataset is sourced from the Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS), which compiles official crime reports submitted by over 500 police and sheriff departments. 

It includes counts and rates (per 100,000 residents) for violent crimes (murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault), property crimes (burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft), and firearm-related incidents. Users can explore trends over time, compare counties, and analyze specific crime categories interactively.

This Crime dataset was downloaded from data.gov (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/index-violent-property-and-firearm-rates-by-county-beginning-1990)""")
